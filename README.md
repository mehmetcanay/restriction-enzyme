## Summary
This module is made for Programming Lab II. Contains 3 classes for analysis of dna incubated with a restriction enzyme.

## Objectives
1. Developing tests for module devolopment
2. Creating RestrictionEnzyme, Fasta, and Dna classes
3. Creating a function to filter rest_dict supplied by Biopython package
4. Creating a function to create a dataframe containing the positions of recognition sites of restriction enzymes in the given DNA sequence

## Material and Methods

### Libraries and software
pdm, pandas

### Data
s
1. [Test sequence](./data/sequence.fasta)
